Descent rate over 2000 fpm at this altitude could pose CFIT risk near terrain; Atlanta area MSA approximately 2500ft MSL, no specific NOTAMs or TFRs identified due to access issues, but check for low-level wind shear per NWS data. Recommended action: contact aircraft to verify clearance and issue altitude reminder.",
