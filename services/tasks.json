    "description": "N408EP, a Cessna 172, is operating at 2125ft MSL with ground speed 110.1kt, position Lat 33.32991 Lon -84.62785, descending at -768ft/min heading 55.73\u00b0, squawking 1200 (VFR). This altitude is below 1000ft AGL over populated areas in violation of FAR 91.119 minimum safe altitude requirements for VFR flight. Atlanta area terrain elevation approximately 1000ft MSL, estimating AGL ~1125ft but location near urban/suburban zones south of KATL suggests potential overflight of congested areas. No specific NOTAMs or TFRs identified due to search limitations, but standard Class B airspace applies; verify if cleared or VFR in IMC if conditions warrant. Recommend immediate traffic advisory and altitude verification.",

Operating at low altitude in Atlanta terminal airspace (Class B), potentially below minimum vectoring altitude (MVA) for sector depending on exact position relative to KATL (approx 10nm west). No active NOTAMs for navaid outages or airspace restrictions identified; METAR at KATL shows VFR conditions (9SM visibility, no ceiling).
