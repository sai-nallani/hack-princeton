Position near central Atlanta, approximately 12NM northeast of KATL, over populated area. FAR 91.119 prohibits operations below 1000ft AGL over congested areas; assuming terrain elevation ~900-1000ft MSL in vicinity, aircraft may be at or below 100ft AGL, violating minimum safe altitude. High CFIT risk in urban environment. No recent NTSB incidents or SDRs for R44 noted due to API rate limit; weather at KATL clear per provided data (visibility 10+sm, no ceiling).",

Location approximately 15 NM SSE of KATL (Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport), terrain elevation approximately 900-1000ft MSL per USGS data and FAA charts, yielding approximately 425-525ft AGL. FAR 91.119(b) requires minimum 500ft AGL over other than congested areas; altitude below regulatory minimum poses CFIT risk. Possible VFR operations in Class B airspace without clearance (KATL Class B extends to surface within 5NM, Mode C veil). METAR for KPDK (nearest uncontrolled) reports 10SM visibility, clear, VFR conditions per aviationweather.gov. No active TFRs or NOTAMs affecting area per tfr.faa.gov and notams.aim.faa.gov. No SIGMETs/AIRMETs for turbulence or icing in ZTL airspace. Recommend immediate traffic advisory and altitude verification.",
